<!--
**gweldit/gweldit** is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on generative models (GANs, Transformers) for malware behavior generation and  polymorphic malware detection  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced sequence modeling and causal reward optimization for GANs
<!--  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ML applications in cybersecurity and NLP
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with benchmarking GANs in security tasks and multilingual NLP datasets  
- 💬 Ask me about machine learning for malware, data exfiltration detection, or YOLO-based CV projects  
- 📫 How to reach me: gereweldit@gmail.com or [gweldit.github.io](https://gweldit.github.io)  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve built detection systems for both cyber threats and parasitic eggs — same precision, different domains!
